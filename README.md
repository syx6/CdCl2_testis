Dissecting the Cellular Microenvironment Underlying Cadmium Chloride (CdCl2)-induced Testicular Injury in Mice

Cadmium Chloride (CdCl2) exposure poses a significant threat to male reproductive health by impairing sperm quality, disrupting testosterone synthesis, inducing oxidative stress, compromising the blood-testis barrier (BTB), and causing DNA damage and hormonal imbalances. Despite well-established associations between Cd exposure and reproductive toxicity, the stage-specific germ cell susceptibility, somatic niche dysregulation, and intercellular crosstalk underlying Cd-induced spermatogenic failure remain poorly definedunresolved at single-cell resolution. Here, we employed Utilizing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), our stto generateudy provides  a comprehensive atlas of Cd-induced testicular toxicity, revealing multiscale disruptions across germline, somatic niche, and intercellular communication networks. We demonstrateidentified stage-specific susceptibilities of that Cd destabilizes spermatogenesis to CdCl2 exposure:through stage-specific vulnerabilities—undifferentiated spermatogonia (SPG) exhibited concurrent activation dual burdens of DNA damage response activation and bioenergetic paralysis (suppression of Hk1and, Fbp1 suppression), while differentiated SPG displayed epigenetic dysregulation (Kdm5b). Sertoli cell subpopulations, particularly Tmem56⁺ cells essential forspecialized in NADH metabolism and BTB maintenance, suffered transcriptional collapse, impairing metabolic coupling and barrier integrity. Leydig cells bifurcated into pro-inflammatory (Cxcl10, Hmox1) and steroidogenic subsets, mechanistically linking CdCl2Cd exposure to endocrine-immune imbalance. Furthermore, CdCl2 reduced Iintercellular communication networks, reflected by undergo systemic erosion with a 36% loss of ligand-receptor interactionspairs (e.g., Agt-Agtr1a, Rxfp2-Insl3), thereby disrupting niche coordination amongbetween SPG, macrophages, and interstitial cells. Collectively, these findings redefine CdCl2Cd toxicity as a hierarchical assault on the testicular ecosystems, offering a roadmap for mitigating the impact of environmental toxicants on male fertility.
